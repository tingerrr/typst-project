# typst-project
typst-project is a small library for interacting with typst projects. It is currently used in
[typst-test], but may be upstreamd to other projects or typst itself at some point.

Planned features are reading and writing 3rd-party tool configs directly into the typst.toml
manifest file with minimal churn for the user using toml-edit.
